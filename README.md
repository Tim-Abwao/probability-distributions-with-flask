# A Flask App For Exploring Statistical Distributions

A simple application to navigate through some common statistical distributions. Powered by [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/), a Python module for development of web applications. The application is live [here](https://statistics-distributions.herokuapp.com).

## Prerequisites
- It's always ideal to work in a virtual environment. Create one at your project directory,  and activate it with:
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
Or, for **Windows**,
```
py -3 -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

- Then install the required packages with:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- There are various ways to run the application. A simple one is:
```
python3 app.py
```
The app should then run at [localhost:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000) Head there, and
enjoy/explore.
